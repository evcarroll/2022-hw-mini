For the hardware mini project, we (Eli and Giacomo) struggled a lot to get the software on our computers to work properly to connect to the Raspberry Pi Pico. We first tried to install the software on the Linux machines in the lab rooms in Photonics 305, but the commands we had to run to configure the CMake project were not working because cmake -B build would not configure the CMake project. We then decided to use Giacomo's windows machine, but we first ran into an issue where the software of the 32-bit ARM GCC compiler was not up-to-date. We therefore tried to update the software but we kept running into denied access issues which we were not able to resolve. Lastly, we used Eli's desktop machine and after fixing a few syntax issues, we were able to build and run both the original and modified examples. 

In the first video, "defaultPWM.MOV" you can clearly see the light slowly turn brighter and then slowly turn the brightness own again, all the way from full brightness to zero light. We then decided to modify the code so that the brightness at each certain point in time would be randomized. As one can clearly see in the second video "ModifiedPWM.MOV", the brightness of the LED keeps changing in an absolutely random pattern. One interesting thing to notice is that when the random brightness selected is the max brightness, the intensity of the light will slowly go down to zero as seen three times in the video.
